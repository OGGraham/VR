# VR

VR assignment. Given data from an IMU (in IMUData.csv) this program calculates the orientation of the users head from the gyroscope. It then corrects these values using the accelerometer and magnetometer.

The program produces some outputs (which you can specify by altering the booleans in main.py) e.g. 3 side-by-side 3D plots of the orientation, 2d plots, a video of the 3d plot

NB: to produce the video output, you must have FFMPEG installed on your machine.
